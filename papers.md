## Type: Consensus
Macular dystrophy does involve the corneal endothelium unlike LCD, so PK may be a better option than DALK. Recurrence after corneal grafting is less common compared with GCD1 and classic LCD.

## Confocal:
Blurred limited accumulations of highly reflective deposits are seen in the basal epithelium and anterior stroma and midstroma (Fig. 14E). Some of these may have dark striae-like images. Normal keratocytes are not seen.

## OCT:
Hyperreflectivity throughout the corneal stroma corresponds to diffuse corneal clouding together with diffuse hyperreflective opacities especially in the Bowman layer (Fig. 14F). Spectral domain OCT can visualize early changes in the Bowman layer while time domain OCT reveals hyperreflective accumulations in the anterior corneal stroma and peripheral posterior cornea stroma.

## Type: review
In MCD, stromal lesions typically start in the first decade of life and patients often progress
to develop severe vision loss by the third decade of life
Initially, minute gray punctate opacities deposit in the cornea in teenage years that progress over time and develop into a diffuse stromal opacity.

Thinning of the central cornea is seen as the disease progresses. (308291, 3484610, 2340750)
With progression, Descemet’s membrane and endothelium are involved with deposits as well. The involvement of Descemet’s membrane with excrescences may eventually lead to endothelial decompensation.

## IVCM
Normal endothelium was reported in this study (17846354)
This study reported changes in the endothelium as well. A change in the shape of cells with bright granular deposits in endothelial cells were seen. (24491640)

## Topo/Tomo
MCD leads to the thinning of the central cornea. In addition, smaller corneal volume and higher
Kmax and front elevations of the cornea have been reported (3484610, 2340750)

## PK
Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) has historically been the most common surgical treatment
to restore visual acuity. However, recurrence after PKP and complications such as endothelial
rejection and endothelial cell loss following transplantation have been documented. 
In a longitudinal study, 6 of 41 (15%) eyes required repeat penetrating
keratoplasty and mean interval between keratoplasty and recurrence was 182 months (15.2
years) (2282944). 
The time from keratoplasty to MCD recurrence ranges from 20 months to 30 years in the literature (12502942). The considerable time between surgery and potential recurrence warrants
following these patients long-term

## DALK
Recently, use of newer partial thickness corneal transplants such as deep anterior lamellar
keratoplasty (DALK) have been employed in MCD, specifically in cases when the endothelium
is not involved. (SogutluSari2013) Unal et al reported a final visual acuity of 20/60 or better in 75% of patients treated with DALK for MCD (unal2013). One case report found no significant difference in endothelial cell count or visual acuity in the two eyes of a patient with MCD who was treated with DALK in one eye and PKP in the fellow eye (patel2009). However, a different study showed that DALK had higher progression of endothelial cell loss following surgery compared to PKP in MCD (kawashima2006). 
A recent study also found that patients who underwent PKP attained better best-corrected visual acuities than those in the DALK group, however complications were fewer with DALK (cheng2013).
The largest study to date comparing PKP and DALK, including 104 patients, showed no
significant difference in visual and refractive outcomes between the two groups. 67% of the
patients undergoing DALK and 60% of the patients undergoing PKP attained BCVA of 20/40 or
better. PK had endothelial graft rejection in 25% of the patients, with 55% in the first year.
Higher graft survival was seen in the PK group compared to DALK, with estimated graft
survival rate of 93% vs 80% at 1 year; and 78% vs 70% at 4 years (reddy2015). Given these results, patients can be advised that surgical intervention offers a good chance of restoring visual acuity in MCD, despite the small but significant risk of recurrence.


# AlAraj2021
## Type: Retrospective cohort study
In this study, they do not have endothelial assessment data for their study population, nor do they specify on what basis patients were allocated to either the DALK or PK group, respectively.

Descemet membrane and endothelial involvement has been histopathologically documented in patients with MCD(Patel2009). Kawashima et al ()kawashima2006) reported progressive loss of endothelial density in patients with MCD who underwent DALK compared to PKP which might be attributed to the natural progression of the disease. However, several studies showed similar or lower endothelial cell loss in patients with MCD who underwent DALK in comparison to PKP (cheng2013, sari2013, patel2009).

## Results
22 DALK cases
There was no statistically significant difference in recurrent episodes between groups (4.5% in DALK vs 2.9% in PK). 
No DALK failed because of endothelial decompensation, although they had 4 cases with intraoperative microperforations; however, these were adequately managed intraoperatively without double AC formation.
A common risk factor of recurrence identified in both groups, which was a small recipient and donor size

# Arora2015
## Type: Letter to the editor concerning Reddy2015
They concluded that DALK may be considered as an option in cases of MCD where there is no direct clinical evidence of deposits on DM. They might have had a high rate of microperforations because of the retrobulbar block as opposed to GA.

A retrospective review of the medical records was performed for all patients who underwent either PK or DALK for MCD at the authors’ institution between January 1990 and December 2021.
DALK was conducted using the big-bubble technique originally described by Anwar and Teichman. When attempts to produce a large bubble were unsuccessful, a manual dissection was carried out layer by layer

No mention of any decision making algorithm to decide on DALK vs PK for patients.
No mention of intraoperative complications

## Results
17 DALK cases
Interface opacity was observed in seven (41.2%) eyes in the DALK group, those that underwent manual dissection during the operation.

## Conclusions: there were no significant differences in the postoperative visual and refractive results between the DALK and PK groups.

# Chaurasia2018
## Type: Case series
Three BB1 DALK cases (all over 40 yo) with uneventful intraoperative course show primary graft failure. Two of them had pre-op CCT of about 550um, thicker than usual macular cases, so probably a sign of pre-op endothelial dysfunction. 

Authors report unpublished data: In those with good visual outcomes after DALK, the mean pachymetry was 462 and conclude that Pre- operative pachymetry may be useful in identifying eyes with poorer endothelial function.

## DALK technique: a manual dissection done by Crescent blade alone after trephination

## Results
21 DALK cases
The best-corrected visual acuity of the PK group was much better than that of the DALK group at all timepoints. 
The corneal endothelial density was reduced to 1000 cells/mm2 or less within 5 years in 21.6% (11/51) of eyes treated by PK and in none of the eyes treated by DALK.
The possible risk factors for disease recurrence: male sex (P  0.059), 18 years of age or younger at onset (P  0.001), younger than 30 years at surgery (P  0.003), and treated with DALK (P  0.000)

In the MCD group, we limited the indication of DALK to the corneas in which the opacity was limited to the anterior to middle stromal layer by slit-lamp examination. This was attributed to the difference in preoperative endothelial density; MCD-DLKP group was 2433/mm2 , whereas that of MCD-PKP was uncountable.

Two of 10 eyes with MCD developed endothelial decompensation

## Conclusion: Collectively, we concluded that DALK is not a safe alternative for MCD, even in eyes with normal endothelial density.

## Type: Retrospective cohort study
## Results:

# Endo eval: Optovue RTVue. AS‑OCT in all patients were obtained and demonstrated involvement only up to the posterior stromal layer. It is an important deciding factor in choosing surgery (DALK vs PK) as very deep involvement and endothelial involvement can result in recurrence.
In 9 out of 16 patients with macular dystrophy, preoperative endothelial count was not obtainable due to dense stromal opacity.

Macular age group 27.9 ± 5.19 years.
Two patients in the macular dystrophy group developed microperforation during separation of posterior stroma from the DM and were successfully managed by air endotamponade.

Recurrence is possible even after successful surgery and has been described both in DALK and PK, and thus it makes more sense to prefer DALK in these patients.

Case report of both eyes of one patient with macular dystrophy. One eye had Melles DALK which found an unacceptable dissection plane so the case was converted to PK, while the other eye had BB (probably type 1) DALK. Both eyes had a great visual and refractive outcome.
DALK, like all new surgical techniques, presents the surgeon with a learning curve and
unfamiliar complications such as Descemet membrane rupture and double-chamber formation.11 However, given the more serious complications associated with ‘‘open-sky’’surgery and the added advantages of lower rejection and graft failure rates, comparable visual acuities, ease of regrafting, low endothelial loss rates, and reduction in steroid therapy, DALK should perhaps be considered as the first choice of treatment.

# Reddy2015
## Type: Retrospective cohort study comparative case series
Tsubota et al8 have reported a case of deep lamellar keratoplasty in MCD as early as 1998 with good success. 
Later, small series were published for deep lamellar keratoplasty for MCD.9–11 
Recently, in a larger series of 43 eyes, Unal et al12 have shown good success of DALK for MCD. 
In direct comparison of DALK and PK for MCD, Kawashima et al9 have suggested that DALK may not be a safe option for MCD, 
whereas Patel et al,13 in their case report have shown comparable results in both the groups.
A more recent study by Chen et al14 has shown a better best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the PK group and recurrence of disease as one of the major risk factors for graft failure in both the groups. 
Sogutlu Sari et al15 have shown comparable BCVAs and contrast sensitivity between the 2 groups, with graft rejection as the major risk factor for graft failure in the PK group and endothelial failure in the DALK group. 

Decision to perform DALK or PK was taken based on the level of deposits noticed on clinical examination. If the deposits were seen in the deeper layers of the cornea on slit-lamp biomicroscopy, PK was preferred.

Four (44%) of the 9 eyes with postoperative DM detachment were as a consequence of intraoperative microperforation. The remaining 5 eyes with postoperative DM detachment, had no microperforation, which may be related to endothelial function in these eyes.

Histopathologically, it is shown that in MCD, deposits are seen even in the endothelium,3 but Patel et al13 have reported comparable endothelial counts between DALK and PK eyes, Sogutlu Sari et al15 and Cheng et al14 have shown higher endothelial cell loss after PK than after DALK, whereas Kawashima et al9 have shown a decreasing trend in the endothelial counts after DALK (lattice vs macular DALK p=0.03 at 12 months only). It is noteworthy to mention that 40% (4/10) of the DALK for MCD cases reported by Kawashima et al9 were associated with postoperative double anterior chamber, 2 of which had intraoperative microperforations, whereas only 6/31 (19.35%) of the lattice cases had this compilation. Therefore, it may be speculated that the ECD difference observed at the 12 month follow-up may be due to this complication.

## Conclusion: DALK may be considered as an option in cases of MCD where there is no direct clinical evidence of deposits on DM.

The technique of injecting air into the corneal stroma to facilitate dissection down to the Descemet’s membrane led to reduced interface haze and better postoperative Downloaded by: University of Hong Kong 198.143.53.1 - 8/17/2015 8:57:21 PM Stage- Related Therapy of Corneal Dystrophies 141 visual results. However, the rate of intraoperative perforation was high (39.2%) [57]. Descemet’s membrane separation is essential in improving the postoperative visual function, as stated by Ardjomand et al. [60]. They suggested that the main parameter for good visual function after DALK for keratoconus is the thickness of the residual recipient stromal bed. DALK performed in an eye with a residual bed thickness of <20 μm can achieve a similar visual result as PKP, whereas the eyes with a recipient stromal bed thickness of >80 μm had a significantly reduced visual acuity

In contrast to the other described techniques of ALKP, the big- bubble technique creates a perfect cleavage plane between Descemet’s membrane and the rest of the corneal tissue and appears to be much safer than the manual technique of achieving deep stromal dissection regarding the incidence of macroperforations. The big- bubble technique also ensures a maximum possible depth dissection achieving a complete baring of Descemet’s membrane so that no stromal tissue is left to cause interface haze in the future [61]. The importance of maintaining an intact Descemet’s membrane was proven by Den et al. [62]. They found that the rate of endothelial decompensation was higher in patients with Descemet’s membrane perforation. They attributed this to either direct insult to the cells associated with perforation or the ensuing pseudochamber formation or gas tamponade. In case Descemet’s membrane separation is not achieved or in case of macroperforation, the procedure is converted to a full- thickness transplantation. Using the excimer laser for lamellar trephination along metal masks, conversion to PKP can be performed without any disadvantage to the patient [63].

Corneal dystrophies require stage- related therapy. To ensure stage- related therapy, adequate classification with respect to histological findings is indispensable

In retrospect, given the acknowledgment by histology of endothelial participation in MCD, it is most likely that such undiagnosed involvement had also occurred in our patients, and as a whole, PKP should be regarded as the procedure of choice in MCD In case of deep stromal deposits sparing the endothelium and Descemet’s membrane DALK may be effective.

Still, there are some corneal dystrophies that require PKP on principle (e.g. macular dystrophy).

# Selvan2018
## Type: Case report
Case report of a young male with macular corneal dystrophy, who underwent DALK in his left eye by Big-Bubble technique. The surgery was uneventful. On the first post-operative day, triple chamber was observed and followed-up with serial clinical photography and anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Due to decrease in graft clarity and increase in volume of the two extra chambers, interface drainage along with descemetopexy was undertaken 4 days later.

The compartments constituting the triple chamber were those in-between the donor tissue and host pre-Descemet layer (Dua’s layer), the latter and host Descemet membrane and the true anterior chamber. Presence of viscoelastic in the interface was identified as the cause. Microscope integrated optical coherence tomography (MiOCT) guided drainage followed by intracameral air tamponade ensured near total disappearance of the two extra chambers at the end of surgery. Examination on the next day confirmed complete apposition of the graft and host.

The patient underwent left eye DALK by Big Bubble technique under general anaesthesia. Partial trephination and lamellar dissection were done. Air was injected in the posterior stroma, and a Big Bubble was formed. A nick was given through the stromal layers to deflate the bubble, and dissection was continued after injecting hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2% (Visilon, Shah & Shah, India) to avoid inadvertent Descemet membrane injury or perforation. Dissection up to Descemet membrane in depth and edge of trephination mark in extent was completed. The donor button Descemet membrane was stained with trypan blue dye 0.06% w/v (Auroblue, Aurolab, India) and was peeled off the donor tissue. The graft was placed over the host bed and secured with interrupted 10-0 monofilament nylon sutures. The graft appeared well apposed to the host bed, and hence the surgery was concluded.

On post-operative day 1, the BCVA was 6/24 with graft clarity (GC) of 3 ? (Collaborative corneal transplantation study group grading) but a ‘triple chamber’ was appreciable (Fig. 2a).), surgical intervention was undertaken 4 days later. Microscope integrated optical coherence tomography (MiOCT) (OPMI LUMERA 700 and RESCAN 700, Carl Zeiss, Meditec, Germany) guided interface drainage was performed under topical anaesthesia. On releasing one suture, there was visible egression of retained viscoelastic from the interface (Fig. 3b). Residual viscoelastic was further aspirated using a cannula, and simultaneous decrease in size of the extra chambers was appreciated on MiOCT. Few pockets of viscoelastic sequestration were still noticeable on the MiOCT, giving a tabletop configuration (Fig. 3c). Air was injected into the anterior chamber to provide intracameral tamponade (descemetopexy).

However, progression of deposits in the endothelial cells can eventually lead to thickening of the Descemet membrane, endothelial decompensation and increased pachymetry .6,15,16

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) High Resolution OCT shows hyperreflectivity at the site of deposits associated with thinning of the epithelium over the deposits.42 Line scans passing through the peripheral cornea characterize the pre-Descemetic nature of the peripheral deposits.15 In some patients, thickening of the Descemet membrane may be noted. In advanced stages of the dystrophy, the dense stromal deposits cause an optical shadow in the posterior part of cornea

In vivo confocal microscopy In vivo confocal microscopy showed altered reflectivity of basal epithelial cells, hyperreflectivity in the anterior stroma, granular appearance of keratocytes and extracellular matrix, and dark striae in the middle and posterior stroma. The endothelial cells showed bright granules and polymegathism.43 In one study, normal endothelium was reported.44

Ultrasound bio microscopy (UBM) ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9 Rubinstein et al42 used UBM in the evaluation of patients with MCD that could help to examine important posterior lamellar changes that could help to decide the choice of keratoplasty- full thickness versus lamellar keratoplasty. UBM helped to characterize posterior corneal surface interruptions, loss of continuity and focal protrusions. Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) could be the surgery of choice compared to deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) in patients with involvement of the posterior corneal layers

Few studies compare outcomes of DALK with PK in MCD (Table-1). In a prospective randomized controlled trial by Sari et al56, there was no significant difference in final visual outcome between both groups. There is significant more endothelial cell loss in PK compared to DALK. Cheng et al had reported better visual outcome in PK group compared to DALK group.57 However, endothelial cell loss was more in PK group. Reddy et al compared clinical outcome and risk factors of graft failure in both groups in a retrospective analysis.58 There was no significant difference in visual outcome, astigmatism and spherical equivalent. Graft rejection was the main cause of graft failure in PK group. Intraoperative micro perforation and double anterior chamber was common complications of DALK. While most complications of DALK happened intraoperatively and early postoperative period, late phase complications such as rejection and secondary glaucoma are more in PK group.59 Late endothelial decompensation after DALK was reported in 2 patients in the same study.59 - kawashima 2006
Kawashima et al5 reported increased endothelial cell loss after DALK in macular corneal dystrophy in comparison to lattice corneal dystrophy. Recurrence of primary pathology is less compared to lattice and granular dystrophy after DALK.60 Primary graft failure has been reported after DALK.61 Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty is described for an atypical case of MCD, wherein glycosaminoglycans deposits were predominantly at the endothelial level.16

The DALK and PK group consisted of 35 and 41 eyes, respectively. Best-corrected visual acuity after surgery was 20/40 or better 68.5% and 70.7% of the eyes in the DALK and PK groups, respectively (P>.05). No statistically significant differences between groups were found in contrast sensitivity function with and without glare for any spatial frequency (P > .05). Significantly higher levels of higher-order aberrations were found in the DALK group (P<.01). In both groups, a progressive and statistically significant reduction in endothelial cell density was found (P < .01). At the last follow-up, the mean endothelial cell loss was 18.1% and 26.9% in DALK and PK groups, respectively (P [ .03). Graft rejection episodes were seen in 5 eyes (12.1%) in the PK group, and regrafting was necessary in 3 eyes (7.3%). Recurrence of the disease was documented in 5.7% and 4.8% of the eyes in the DALK and PK groups, respectively.

Although DALK has several advantages over PK, there have been concerns about its role in macular dystrophy because of the involvement of deeper layers of stroma and possibly the Descemet membrane. Some investigators believe that DALK is not suitable for the treatment of macular corneal dystrophy, claiming that the stromal and endothelial involvement as well as the fragility of Descemet membrane in macular corneal dystrophy would lead to interface opacities and higher rates of endothelial cell attrition after DALK.4,10

A TOTAL OF 82 EYES OF 54 PATIENTS WITH MACULAR corneal dystrophy were included. An equal number of eyes (41 eyes) underwent DALK and PK surgery. No intraoperative complication occurred in the PK group. Conversion to PK was needed in 6 eyes (14.6%) in the DALK group because of macroperforation. Therefore, the data analysis included 41 eyes in the PK group and 35 eyes in the DALK group. Complete Descemet membrane exposure was achieved in 27 eyes (77.1%; desmetic DALK [dDALK]) via the big-bubble technique; however, layer-by-layer manual stromal dissection was needed in 8 eyes (22.8%; predesmetic DALK [pdDALK]).

At the last follow-up, UCVA was 20/40 or better in 11 eyes (31.4%) in the DALK group and in 14 eyes (34.1%) in the PK group (P > .05). Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 24 eyes (68.5%) in the DALK group and in 29 eyes (70.7%) in the PK group (P > .05). Uncorrected visual acuity was significantly better in the dDALK group than in the pdDALK group (P ¼ .04). Although not significant, BCVA also was better in dDALK group (Table 3).

contrast sensitivity function under mesopic conditions measured with and without a glare source. As shown, no statistically significant differences between groups were found in contrast sensitivity measured without glare for any spatial frequency.

Comparing the subgroups, the mean contrast sensitivity function under photopic and mesopic conditions were not different between the dDALK and pdDALK groups for each of the spatial frequencies (P > .05).
Significantly higher levels of higher-order aberrations (HOAs), primary coma aberrations, spherical aberrations, and residual aberrations were found in the DALK group (HOA RMS, P < .01; coma aberration RMS, P < .01; spherical aberration RMS, P < .01; residual aberration RMS, P ¼ .03). No significant differences between groups were detected in the total RMS (P ¼ .17). Significant correlations between contrast sensitivity and HOA RMS were observed only in the DALK group

Significantly higher endothelial cell density loss was observed in the PK group compared with the DALK group at 24 months after surgery (P ¼ .03) as well as at the last postoperative follow-up visit (P < .01). Comparing the subgroups, the mean endothelial cell losses were not different between the dDALK and pdDALK groups (P > .05). 

Microperforation occurred in 5 eyes (14.2%) in the DALK group, and a double anterior chamber was seen in 1 eye (2.8%) that resolved completely after an intracameral air injection. Stromal graft rejection episodes were seen in 3 eyes (8.5%) from the DALK group that were treated successfully and resolved with topical corticosteroids. In the PK group, endothelial graft rejection episodes were seen in 5 eyes (12.1%). Two of these cases (4.8%) resolved successfully with medical treatment, whereas regrafting was necessary in 3 eyes (7.3%), which was performed at 26, 33, and 35 months after the first graft. Furthermore, regrafting was performed in 1 eye (2.8%) in the DALK group at 28 months because of endothelial decompensation. In addition, 1 eye (2.4%) underwent resuturing in the PK group because of the traumatic graft dehiscence. Recurrence of the disease was documented in 2 eyes (5.7%) from the DALK group and also in 2 eyes (4.8%) from the PK group. Complications are documented in Table 4.

The Descemet membrane-baring techniques such as the Anwar big-bubble technique provide comparable visual results with or even better than PK as confirmed in a case-control study.11,13 This suggests that the visual outcomes of PK remain superior to those of DALK unless baring of the Descemet membrane is complete. Tan and associates also reported that techniques such as the Anwar big-bubble technique yielded visual results that were equivalent or superior to those of PK.13

Regarding macular corneal dystrophy, in which the use of lamellar keratoplasty is a cause of concern, no appropriate comparison between DALK and PK has been carried out to this date. In this prospective and randomized clinical study, we compared visual and optical quality, effect on corneal endothelium, and surgical complications of big-bubble DALK and PK for macular corneal dystrophy. After surgery, UCVA and BCVA improved significantly in both groups. This is consistent with the results of previous studies. Vajpayee and associates performed bigbubble DALK in 5 cases of macular corneal dystrophy, and BCVA improved in all cases.14 Another DALK study with stromal dystrophies reported a postoperative BCVA of 20/40 or better in 75.4% of the eyes.15 In the present study, BCVA was 20/40 or better in 68.5% and 70.7% of the eyes in the DALK and PK groups, respectively. This visual outcome was found in 55% of eyes from a large series of macular corneal dystrophy cases treated with PK.16
Patel and associates compared DALK and PK performed in the right and left eye, respectively, of a subject with macular corneal dystrophy.10 These authors achieved an acceptable bed clarity with the big-bubble technique, and controversially obtained better visual outcomes with it compared with PK in the other eye.

In the current study, we also performed subgroup analyses between dDALK and pdDALK groups and we observed superior visual outcomes with dDALK patients. It seems to be related to interface problems, which is of critical importance in achieving comparable visual outcomes to PK after DALK surgery. Interface haze may interfere with BCVA and contrast sensitivity because of increase in HOAs and scattering, leading to a decrease in visual quality. Interface irregularity was seen in 11.4% of the eyes in our DALK patients and all of them in pdDALK group.

Therefore, corneal surgeons must keep in mind that DALK surgery using layer-by-layer manual dissection may result in poorer visual outcomes than Descemet membrane-baring techniques in macular corneal dystrophy patients; however, larger series are needed to evaluate this further.

 In contrast to the contrast sensitivity outcomes of the current series, significant differences were observed in corneal HOAs between PK and DALK groups. Specifically, HOA, primary coma aberration, and residual aberration RMS as well as the coefficient corresponding to the primary spherical aberration were significantly higher in the DALK group

This suggests that the air–cornea interface, which is the first and most important refractive medium and constitutes most of the total refractive power of the eye, is more aberrated after surgery in eyes with macular corneal dystrophy undergoing DALK surgery compared with those undergoing PK. According to this, contrast sensitivity outcomes also should have been poorer in the DALK group, but this was not the case. One explanation for this may be the relevant contribution of the posterior corneal surface in these cases. Indeed, Yamaguchi and associates found in a comparative study of anterior and posterior corneal aberrations after PK and DALK that posterior surfaces compensated significantly for anterior aberrations.21 In any case, significant inverse correlations between HOA RMS and mesopic contrast sensitivity were found only in our DALK group, which confirms that this group of patients was more susceptible to having contrast sensitivity  affected by corneal aberrations, especially in those cases with postoperative levels of HOA.

A recent study found a 5-year postoperative endothelial cell density loss of 22.3% after DALK and of 50.1% after PK in eyes with different corneal pathologic features.25 In a similar study, Shimazaki and associates prospectively compared DALK and PK over a 2-year period and demonstrated an accelerated decrease of endothelial cell density in the PK group.19 In the current study with macular corneal dystrophy, mean endothelial cell loss was calculated as 13.2% at 6 months, 15.4% at 12 months, 16.3% at 24 months, and 18.1% at the last follow-up visit in the DALK group. In the PK group, the percentages were 12.1%, 15.0%, 22.1%, and 26.9% for the respective postoperative visits.

Endothelial decompensation needing regraft surgery developed in only 1 eye (2.8%) in our DALK group. 

 However, the risk of endothelial decompensation should be kept in mind when evaluating a patient with macular corneal dystrophy before surgery. The use of optical coherence tomography to determine a lack of endothelial involvement may be more informative for surgeons.

Unal and associates recently documented a 2.3% recurrence rate after bigbubble DALK for macular corneal dystrophy.15 In the present study, recurrence of the disease was documented in 2 eyes (5.7%) from the DALK group and in 2 eyes (4.8%) from the PK group after 30 months of follow-up. Previous studies have shown that the recurrence rate increased in direct proportion with the follow-up period and that there was a subsequent need for regrafting.26,27 We believe that recurrence of stromal dystrophies would be comparatively easier to manage with lamellar keratoplasty.

There were 44 eyes with macular corneal dystrophy, 18 eyes with lattice dystrophy, and 12 eyes with granular dystrophy. DALK was completed in 69 cases (94.6%). Descemet membrane microperforations occurred in 6 eyes (8.7%). The mean follow-up period was 43.5 ± 23.9 months, ranging from 12 to 96 months. Postoperative best spectacle–corrected visual acuity of 0.5 or better was present in 52 of 69 eyes (75.4%). There were 3 episodes of stromal graft rejection, which responded to topical therapy.
 One of the most important advantages over penetrating keratoplasty (PK) is the elimination of endothelial graft rejection. Also, because topical steroids can be discontinued earlier, there is less risk of secondary infection, delayed wound healing, cataract development, or glaucoma after DALK surgery.3–11
DALK was attempted in 74 eyes of 65 consecutive patients with stromal corneal dystrophies. Surgeries were performed with the patient under general or retrobulbar anesthesia using the big bubble technique as described by Anwar and Teichmann.12 As first defined by Sarnicola et al13 and then others,4–6,8 patients who had complete DM exposure via the big bubble were termed as the Descemetic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (dDALK) group. In cases where a big bubble was not accomplished after more than one attempt, a layer-by-layer manual stromal dissection was performed under direct visualization. The surgeon intended to reach the maximal depth by exposing a plane as close as possible to the DM. This group of DALK patients was termed as the predescemetic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (pdDALK) group. At the end of the operation, air was injected intracamerally to prevent formation of a double anterior chamber in all cases.
The host–graft disparity was kept at 0.25 to 0.5 mm with the donor graft being larger than the host graft. The donor lenticule was secured over the recipient bed with 16 interrupted or a combination of 8 interrupted and 1 continuous 16-bite 10-0 monofilament nylon sutures. Keratoscopy was performed intraoperatively to adjust suture tension.
There were 43 eyes of 39 patients with macular corneal dystrophy.
Complete DM exposure could be achieved in 56 cases (81%) in the dDALK group via the big bubble. Thirteen eyes (19%) required layer-by-layer manual dissection in the pdDALK group because of the lack of a big bubble after several attempts.
Microperforation of DM was observed in 6 eyes (8.7%) during the stromal dissection phase, but this did not affect the subsequent surgical steps, leading to the uneventful completion of the DALK procedure. A double anterior chamber was noted in the immediate postoperative period in 4 eyes (5.8%) with intraoperative DM microperforation. DM reattached to graft stroma with conservative management in 3 eyes. The other eye required C3F8 gas injection into the anterior chamber.

 Significant reduction of visual acuity necessitated a new DALK procedure in 4 patients with lattice dystrophy and 1 patient with granular dystrophy. The earliest recurrence was in an eye with granular dystrophy 14 months after surgery. Mean time from surgery to recurrence was 33.0 ± 7.7 months (range 14– 82 months). 

There was no graft failure associated with graft rejection. There were 3 instances of stromal graft rejection (between 4 and 9 months after surgery) in 3 eyes (4.3%). There was a complete reversal of stromal edema after initiation of intensive topical corticosteroid therapy.

All eyes had better visual acuity at 6 months postoperatively than they had preoperatively. A BSCVA of 0.5 or better was present in 3 eyes (4.4%) preoperatively and 52 eyes (75.4%) postoperatively. Comparing the BSCVAs of dDALK and pdDALK groups, the difference was not statistically significant (P . 0.05).
Seventeen eyes had a postoperative BSCVA worse than 0.5. Recurrence of original disease was responsible in 5 eyes. Age-related macular changes and nuclear sclerosis were noted in 2 and 5 eyes, respectively. The remaining 5 eyes seemed to have a poor BSCVA because of high postoperative astigmatism. Selective suture removal was performed in 19 patients for control of astigmatism from 6 weeks onward. All the study eyes had removal of all sutures at the last examination.
Despite the potential advantages of anterior lamellar surgery over PK, there have been some concerns regarding the visual function achieved by patients with lamellar grafts. This has been attributed mainly to host–donor interface opacities or irregularity, especially in cases performed with manual techniques leading to remaining corneal stroma on the recipient bed.3 Recently, DALK has gained popularity again because of improvements in surgical techniques and the availability of new surgical instruments and devices that have helped to improve surgical success and reduce surgery time.4–7,12 Interface haze is rarely a problem with DM-baring procedures. As a DM-baring technique, the big bubble technique involves air injection into the deep stroma with the aim of inducing separation by cleavage between posterior stroma and the DM, allowing the surgeon to gain safe and direct access to this plane. It has the advantage of exposing a smooth surface of excellent optical quality. In a study comparing 3 techniques used for removing the recipient stroma during anterior lamellar keratoplasty, the best visual outcomes were obtained using the big bubble technique.14
Many studies have reported the safety and efficacy of big bubble DALK surgery and concluded that visual and refractive outcomes were comparable with those of PK.3,8,10,12,15
Macroperforations that necessitated conversion to PK occurred in 5 eyes (6.8%) in our series. 
We used the big bubble technique to bare the DM in the present study, and we achieved it in 56 eyes (81%). The rates of successful big bubble procedures have been reported to range between 100% and 40%.4,9
. Immunologic rejection episodes have been reported to range between 0% and 14.3% after DALK surgery, being reversible in most cases with appropriate therapy.3–11 
Recurrence of the corneal stromal dystrophies in the corneal graft is another important problem and expected for PK or DALK. Recurrence seems to be closely associated with the time interval after the procedure. No recurrence was reported in DALK series with a short-term follow-up period.7,9

It is suspected that recurrence of a stromal dystrophy occurs because of retained host stroma and would be less likely with the DM-baring techniques.3
Regrafting is a relatively simple procedure after anterior lamellar surgery. Therefore, performing DALK may be a better option in these cases, as repeat procedures may be necessary over a lifetime.

One of the many techniques to achieve lamellar dissection down to DM in corneal opacities is the big-bubble technique, which uses air to create a plane of dissection between DM and corneal stroma.5 The technique of DALK has been largely used in treating cases of keratoconus, as it provides a safer and successful alternative to PK.6–9 Recently, the procedure has been used to treat stromal corneal dystrophies using the viscodissection technique.10 In the present study, we evaluated the use of DALK using the big-bubble technique5 for new indications including cases of stromal corneal dystrophy and corneal clouding attributable to mucopolysaccharidosis.

DALK was performed in all cases under general anesthesia using the big-bubble technique. A Hessburg Barron (JedMed Instrument Co, St Louis, Missouri, USA) suction trephine (7.00 mm to 7.5 mm) was used for partial-thickness trephination of the host cornea up to an approximate depth of 300 m. A 27-gauge disposable needle bent at 90 degrees was advanced in the paracentral stroma, and air was injected into the corneal stromal tissue, which formed a large air bubble between DM and the host’s corneal stroma. Subsequently, debulking the anterior two-thirds of the superficial corneal stroma was performed using a crescent blade (Alcon Surgical, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) and left a very thin layer of corneal stromal tissue over the large air bubble. A paracentesis was created using a 15-degree blade (Alcon Surgical) at the 10-o’clock position to lower the intraocular pressure of the eye. A small opening was then created in the stromal tissue overlying the air bubble using a 15-degree blade (Alcon Surgical), and after the egress of the air bubble from the incision site, 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Visilon, Shah & Shah, Mumbai, India) was injected through the opening to maintain the space between the remaining corneal stromal tissue and DM. A curved Vannas scissors (Appasamy Associates, Chennai, India) was used to divide the stromal tissue into four quadrants, and each quadrant was excised baring the DM completely.
DALK WAS PERFORMED SUCCESSFULLY USING THE BIGbubble technique in all eyes, and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. A complete baring of the DM in the area of trephination was achieved in all eyes. Reinjection of the air bubble was required in one eye attributable to the formation of an incomplete air bubble. In two cases of macular corneal dystrophy, some adhesions were encountered intraoperatively between deeper stromal opacities and DM. These adhesions were successfully separated by gentle blunt dissection.
Selective suture removal was done in three eyes to control astigmatism. At six months, a BCVA of 20/40 or better was achieved in all eyes. None of the eyes demonstrated any interface haze on slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and there were no instances of stromal graft rejection or graft infection 
The advantages of DALK over PK as a treatment for corneal stromal disease are well known,11 the most important of which is that there is no risk for endothelial graft rejection. In addition, compared to PK, the technique has all the advantages of a lamellar procedure: avoiding most complications associated with “open-sky” surgery, lesser chances of postoperative complications such as anterior synechiae of iris or secondary glaucoma, and easier postoperative management.
The corneal endothelium is spared in cases of granular, lattice, and in early cases of macular corneal dystrophy, thereby rationalizing the use of DALK in these cases.3,12
In a randomized controlled trial, Shimazaki and associates compared the visual outcomes of PK with DLK, using intrastromal air or balanced saline, in eyes with stromal opacities. The mean postoperative BCVA at the end of six months was comparable in the two groups, but the recovery period was longer in the DLK group.11 In an agematched controlled study, Kawashima and associates compared the outcomes of PK with DLK in eyes with lattice and macular corneal dystrophies. DLK was performed by either removing stromal tissue gradually or by viscodissection of DM. However, macroperforations occurred in 14.6% of the cases requiring conversion to PK.10 In our study, there were no instances of Descemet perforations necessitating a conversion to PK
In contrast to the other described techniques of DLK, the big-bubble technique creates a perfect cleavage plane between DM and the rest of the corneal tissue and appears to be much safer than the manual technique of achieving deep stromal dissection regarding the instances of macroperforations. The big-bubble technique also ensures a maximum possible depth dissection achieving a complete baring of DM so that no stromal tissue is left to cause interface haze in the future. Attributable to this lack of a graft-host stromal interface, visual recovery may be faster and better as compared with the other techniques of DLK achieving incomplete stromal dissection.5
The stromal dystrophies are known to recur within the donor material after corneal transplantation and therefore may require multiple grafts. Several studies have reported the recurrence of stromal corneal dystrophies after PK,14,15 and a repeat corneal transplantation surgery is required to treat these recurrences. Performing DALK may be a better option in these cases, as repeat procedures may be necessary over a lifetime.
 In addition to eliminating the risk of endothelial rejection, low-quality donor corneal tissue can be used, therefore easing the shortage of good-quality donor tissue prevalent in developing countries.

## Type: Review
In a previous retrospective study, we followed 51 MCD patients over an 18-year period and found that patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) had a lower recurrence rate and delayed recurrence onset compared with those undergoing deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) (Cheng et al., 2013). The five-year recurrence rate of PKP is 7.7% while that of DALK was 49.5% (Cheng et al., 2013). In another study that included 84 eyes with MCD and lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), which also belongs to stromal dystrophies, MCD patients with DALK had a progressive decrease of corneal endothelial density, which was not observed in the LCD group (Kawashima et al., 2006). A more recent study involving 109 MCD eyes with PKP and 21 MCD eyes with DALK found a higher graft survival rate in the PKP group than in the DALK group (Reddy et al., 2015). These results suggest that DALK might not be the optimal surgery for MCD.
We hypothesized that the corneal endothelium, which is not replaced in DALK but is replaced in PKP, may play a role in the recurrence and clinical outcomes of MCD.
Endothelial black holes were already observed through corneal confocal microscopy in a six-year-old girl with early-stage MCD (Figure 1B), implying an early involvement of endothelium in MCD. In MCD patients who undergo PKP, the endothelial density (3,534 cells per mm2) and morphology remain healthy (Figure 1C). However, a recurrent MCD patient receiving DALK exhibited abundant abnormal deposits in the endothelial layer and decreased endothelial density (1,543 cells per mm2) (Figure 1D), indicating the crucial role of the endothelium in maintaining corneal transparency. - nu sunt sigur de paragraful asta
An example of a typical recurrence case after 11 years of PKP showed haze likely originating from the peripheral host cornea and spreading towards the edges of the graft, as observed through optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Figure 1E). On the other hand, a typical recurrence case after 8.7 years of DALK showed haze developing from the bottom of the host cornea (Figure 1F), indicating a possible association between the residual endothelium and MCD recurrence in DALK.
A total of 102 MCD patients with 124 eyes who underwent corneal transplantation at Qingdao Eye Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 10.89% (11/101) of MCD eyes receiving PKP and 39.13% (9/23) of eyes receiving DALK by manual dissection were diagnosed with recurrences (Figure 1G). The MCD recurrent rate was significantly associated with the surgical method (P=0.017, χ2 test). The average time to recurrence was significantly longer for eyes receiving PKP, with 6.38±3.34 years compared with 2.56±2.71 years for eyes receiving DALK (P=0.017, Mann-Whitney U test).
