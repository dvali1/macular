              is the ultimate therapeutic solution for MCD patients.
              Unfortunately, postoperative recurrence remains a significant
              challenge. We conducted a retrospective review of a clinical
              cohort comprising 102 MCD patients with 124 eyes that underwent
              either penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) or deep anterior lamellar
              keratoplasty (DALK). Our results revealed that the recurrence
              rate was nearly three times higher in the DALK group (39.13\%,
              9/23 eyes) compared with the PKP group (10.89\%, 11/101 eyes),
              suggesting that surgical replacement of the corneal endothelium
              for treating MCD is advisable to prevent postoperative
              recurrence. Our experimental data confirmed the robust mRNA and
              protein expression of CHST6 in human corneal endothelium and the
              rodent homolog CHST5 in mouse endothelium. Selective knockdown of
              wild-type Chst5 in mouse corneal endothelium (ACsiChst5), but not
              in the corneal stroma, induced experimental MCD with similar
              extracellular matrix synthesis impairments and corneal thinning
              as observed in MCD patients. Mice carrying Chst5 point mutation
              also recapitulated clinical phenotypes of MCD, along with corneal
              endothelial abnormalities. Intracameral injection of wild-type
              Chst5 rescued the corneal impairments in ACsiChst5 mice and
              retarded the disease progression in Chst5 mutant mice. Overall,
              our study provides new mechanistic insights and therapeutic

               bilateral gradual and painless blurred vision with photophobia
               of three years duration. Cornea of both eyes showed focal
               grayish opacities in anterior and mid stroma with intervening
               stromal haze. There was no history of consanguinity in the
               family. Anterior segment ocular coherence tomography showed
               thinning of cornea and deposits in corneal stroma. Macular
               corneal dystrophy was the clinical diagnosis and the patient
               underwent deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty in the right eye.
               Histopathological examination and histochemical staining with
               Alcian Blue supported the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Significant
               improvement in vision was observed in the operated eye. MCD may
               be present in communities without evidence of consanguinity. It
               can cause visual impairment at an early age. Timely intervention

               stromal dystrophy with bilateral progressive vision loss. The
               pathogenic gene of MCD is carbohydrate sulfotransferase 6

               exon deletion mutation in the CHST6 gene in a Chinese family
               with MCD. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral
               blood, and next generation sequencing was used to analyse the
               gene sequence. The pathogenic mutations were identified in all
               affected family members. The proband successively received
               binocular penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), and the corneas were
               examined by histopathology and colloidal iron staining to prove
               the diagnosis. A long-term follow-up was made to observe the
               changes after PKP. RESULTS: Genetic analysis demonstrated
               hemizygous mutations in the proband, including a novel c.520A>C
               (p.K174Q) missense mutation and a rarely reported exon 3
               deletion mutation, which were co-segregated with the MCD
               phenotypes in the pedigree. The positive colloidal iron staining
               confirmed the diagnosis of MCD in the proband. However, the
               clinical phenotype and pathological manifestation of both eyes
               were different from each other because of complicated keratitis
               in the left eye. During the nine years of follow-up, visual
               acuity was improved significantly, and the cornea was
               transparent without rejection and postoperative recurrence in
               both eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The novel hemizygous mutations were
               thought to contribute to the loss of CHST6 function, which
               induced typical clinical and pathological features of MCD. PKP

               endothelial count could be obtained (due to dense stromal
               corneal opacity), but there was a significant endothelial count
               difference between preoperative and postoperative count in group
               B (GCD, P= 0.0405) at the end of 1 year postoperatively which
               could be because of age and stage of disease (advanced granular
               dystrophy) and also because of small sample size of GCD compared
               with MCD. Intergroup comparison between the two groups showed no
               statistically significant difference (P = 0.6353) with good
               postoperative outcome in both groups. Conclusion: DALK can be
               successfully done in both groups and results are comparable.

              of different types of big bubble (BB) during DALK. Methods: In
              this retrospective study, 322 consecutive eyes of 307 patients
              with corneal stromal disorders who underwent DALK between January
              2014 and June 2017 were included. Age, sex, corneal pathology,
              visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness, and adverse
              events were recorded. The main outcome measure was the success of
              BB formation with respect to the corneal pathology. Results:
              Type-1 BB was achieved in 147 eyes (45.7\%), whereas type-2 BB
              was formed in 109 eyes (33.9\%). The overall success rate of BB
              formation was 82.9\%. Type-1 BB formation in keratoconus patients
              was significantly higher than type-2 BB (83.8\% vs 2.6\%, p <
              0.001). In contrast, type-2 BB formation was significantly higher
              than type-1 BB (61.0\% vs 15.6\%, p < 0.001) in patients with
              corneal scars. Type-1 BB was more likely to be seen in patients
              with superficial corneal scarring, granular, and lattice

               (January 2009 to December 2015) of sixteen eyes of sixteen

  abstract = "Macular corneal dystrophy is a corneal stromal dystrophy which
              leads to progressive vision loss. Macular corneal dystrophy is an
              autosomal recessive condition in which there is abnormality of
              proteoglycan synthesis. Mutations in the carbohydrate
              sulfotransferase gene prevent normal sulfation of corneal
              keratan. Different immunophenotypes have been described depending
              on the presence of keratan sulfate in cornea and/or serum. The
              deposition of abnormal proteoglycans leads to loss of corneal
              transparency and decreased vision. Imaging techniques such as in
              vivo confocal microscopy and anterior segment ocular coherence
              tomography have helped enhance our understanding of the corneal
              ultrastructural changes in this condition. These imaging
              modalities provide additional information without the need for a
              tissue biopsy or excision. Traditionally, full-thickness
              penetrating keratoplasty to replace the opacified cornea has
              remained the standard of treatment to improve vision. However,
              newer surgical interventions such as deep anterior lamellar
              keratoplasty and phototherapeutic keratectomy have also been
              shown to play a role in the treatment. Disease recurrence remains
              a challenge and the reason for poor visual prognosis. Newer
              techniques such as gene-targeting therapies and enzyme
              replacement therapies are being studied for a potential permanent
              solution in macular corneal dystrophy. Recent research is
              directed toward development of genetically modified products to
              integrate into host corneal DNA and block the mutant genes and
              hence overcome the underlying pathophysiology. Enzyme replacement
              therapy is another intervention with potential to treat macular
              corneal dystrophy. Animal studies show clearance of accumulated
              keratan sulfate from the body tissues in the treatment of
              systemic mucopolysaccharidosis by long-term enzyme replacement
              therapy. Future research should be directed toward elucidation of
              the relationship between the mutated carbohydrate
              sulfotransferase gene, the mechanism of deposit formation, and
              the development of pharmaceutical agents based on gene therapy.",

               METHOD: Case report of a young male with macular corneal
               dystrophy, who underwent DALK in his left eye by Big-Bubble
               technique. The surgery was uneventful. On the first
               post-operative day, triple chamber was observed and followed-up
               with serial clinical photography and anterior segment optical
               coherence tomography. Due to decrease in graft clarity and
               increase in volume of the two extra chambers, interface drainage
               along with descemetopexy was undertaken 4 days later. RESULT:
               The compartments constituting the triple chamber were those
               in-between the donor tissue and host pre-Descemet layer (Dua's
               layer), the latter and host Descemet membrane and the true

               tomography (OCT) and Scheimpflug. METHODS: Six patients with MCD
               were examined for their best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp,
               OCT, UBM, and Scheimpflug findings. Blood samples for DNA and
               exons of the CHST6 gene were screened for mutations. RESULTS:
               All 6 patients showed typical MCD signs at the slit lamp.
               Corneal transplantation was required in 2 patients in both eyes.
               Recurrence of MCD was observed in 2 eyes after the DALK
               procedure (patient A5, age 48 years, right eye and B1, 51 years,
               left eye), whereas the 2 eyes after PK (patient A5, age 48
               years, left eye and patient B1, 51 years, right eye) remained
               clear (for 10 years of follow-up in patient A5 and 4 years in
               patient B1). In 2 patients (A1 and A3), corneal thinning could
               be evaluated by OCT. In 3 patients (A2, 3, and 4), UBM disclosed
               deeper pathologies including opacities, loss of continuity, and
               focal protrusions of the posterior cornea, which were not
               evident by other devices. In family A, a novel mutation was

               alterations of the cornea's posterior layer and confirms the
               known clinical and histological findings of MCD that PK
               represents the therapy of choice, contrary to DALK. The novel

               group consisted of 109 eyes of 84 patients and the DALK group
               consisted of 21 eyes of 20 patients. The mean logarithm of the
               minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity at 3
               and 12 months was 0.5 versus 0.5 (P = 0.285) and 0.4 versus 0.4
               (P = 0.67) in the DALK and PK groups, respectively. There was no
               significant statistical difference in astigmatism and spherical

               graft rejection that was the most common cause of graft failure
               was seen in 27 eyes (25\%), of which 55\% occurred within 1
               year. In the DALK group, Descemet membrane microperforation

               postoperative Descemet membrane detachment with double anterior

               1 year and 78\% versus 70\% at 4 years, respectively.
               CONCLUSIONS: Visual and refractive outcomes are comparable
               between DALK and PK groups. DALK was superior to PK in its
               safety against postoperative complications such as endothelial
               rejection and secondary glaucoma. Graft failure in DALK was
               mostly associated with either intraoperative or early
               postoperative complications. DALK is a viable surgical option in
               cases with macular corneal dystrophy.",

               follow-up, the mean endothelial cell loss was 18.1\% and 26.9\%
               in DALK and PK groups, respectively (P = .03). Graft rejection
               episodes were seen in 5 eyes (12.1\%) in the PK group, and
               regrafting was necessary in 3 eyes (7.3\%). Recurrence of the
               disease was documented in 5.7\% and 4.8\% of the eyes in the
               DALK and PK groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Deep anterior
               lamellar keratoplasty with the big-bubble technique provided
               comparable visual and optical results as PK and resulted in less
               endothelial damage, as well as eliminating endothelial rejection
               in macular corneal dystrophy. Deep anterior lamellar
               keratoplasty surgery is a viable option for macular corneal

               on patients with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) and to analyze
               the risk factors of postoperative recurrence. DESIGN:
               Retrospective, interventional, comparative case series.
               PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one patients (78 eyes) with MCD treated by
               PK or DALK at Shandong Eye Institute between January 1992 and
               December 2010. METHODS: The medical records of the patients were
               reviewed retrospectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected
               visual acuity, corneal endothelial density, complications,
               recurrence, graft survival, and risk factors for recurrence.
               RESULTS: Penetrating keratoplasty was performed in 57 eyes, and
               DALK was performed in 21 eyes. The mean follow-up time was
               5.1$\pm$4.1 years (range, 1.0-18.0 years). The best-corrected
               visual acuity of the PK group was much better than that of the
               DALK group at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years. The corneal endothelial
               density was reduced to 1000 cells/mm2 or less within 5 years in
               21.6\% (11/51) of eyes treated by PK and in none of the eyes
               treated by DALK. The 1-year incidence rate of complications was
               21.1\% in the PK group, higher than the 4.8\% rate in the DALK
               group. At the last visit, the rate of graft clarity was 87.7\%
               and 85.7\% in the 2 groups, respectively. Ten eyes (17.5\%)
               treated by PK had recurrent MCD, with a rate of 0.8\%, 7.7\%,
               and 40\% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, whereas 9 eyes
               (42.9\%) treated by DALK demonstrated recurrence, with a rate of
               14.3\% and 49.5\% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The recurrence
               risk was higher in patients whose age was 18 years or younger at
               onset or younger than 30 years at surgery. The recurrence risk
               after DALK was 5.066 times higher than that after PK.
               CONCLUSIONS: Penetrating keratoplasty more often immediately
               improves the visual acuity of patients with MCD, but many
               complications seem to be inevitable, especially continuous loss
               of corneal endothelium. Despite poor visual acuity and
               recurrence after surgery, DALK may produce fewer complications
               overall and more durable stability of the ocular surface
               compared with PK. The selection of PK or DALK for MCD should
               depend on the actual need and situation of certain patients.

               dystrophies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four eyes of 65
               patients who underwent DALK for stromal corneal dystrophies were
               evaluated in this retrospective interventional case series
               study. Main outcome measures were intraoperative and
               postoperative complications, postoperative uncorrected visual
               acuity, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, spherical
               equivalent refraction, and topographic astigmatism. RESULTS:
               There were 44 eyes with macular corneal dystrophy, 18 eyes with
               lattice dystrophy, and 12 eyes with granular dystrophy. DALK was
               completed in 69 cases (94.6\%). Descemet membrane
               microperforations occurred in 6 eyes (8.7\%). The mean follow-up
               period was 43.5 $\pm$ 23.9 months, ranging from 12 to 96 months.
               Postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 0.5 or
               better was present in 52 of 69 eyes (75.4\%). There were 3
               episodes of stromal graft rejection, which responded to topical
               therapy. Lattice dystrophy recurred in 6 eyes (35.3\%).

               spare the Descemet's membrane (DM) and endothelium. However, it
               is not always possible to conclusively recognise formation and

               the surgeon to definitely and immediately identify the formation
               of an adequate big bubble. DALK was performed using the 'Double
               Bubble' technique in twelve eyes of twelve patients with corneal
               stromal pathologies (keratoconus, 9 eyes; macular corneal

  author   = "Seitz, Berthold and Lisch, Walter",
  abstract = "Corneal dystrophies typically result in a gradual bilateral loss
              of vision in a primary 'white eye' - often in conjunction with
              epithelial defects in later stages. Treatment of corneal
              dystrophies needs to be stage-related. To ensure a stage-related
              therapeutic approach, an adequate classification based on
              clinical, histopathological and genetic knowledge is
              indispensable. In principle, topical medications, contact lenses
              and various microsurgical approaches are applicable. In case of
              predominantly superficial dystrophies of the epithelium, basal
              membrane and/or Bowman's layer (map-dot-fingerprint, Meesmann,
              Lisch, Reis-B{\"u}cklers, Thiel-Behnke), recurrent epithelial
              defects may complicate the clinical picture. If conservative
              therapy with gels/ointments, application of therapeutic contact
              lenses and/or conventional corneal abrasion are not successful,
              phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using a 193-nm excimer laser
              is the method of choice today. PTK can be repeated several times,
              thus post poning corneal transplantation (lamellar or even
              penetrating) for a long time. Three major goals may be achieved
              by PTK depending on the diagnosis: (1) to remove superficial
              opacities; (2) to regularize the surface and treat irregular
              astigmatism, and (3) to improve the adherence of the epithelium.
              In dystrophies with depositions predominantly in the stroma (e.g.
              granular, lattice, macular, recurrence on the graft), PTK may be
              a reasonable alternative to anterior lamellar or penetrating
              keratoplasty (PKP) depending on the exact localization of the
              lesions. Besides exact determination of the depth of depositions
              using a slit lamp, a preoperative topography analysis is
              indispensable. The therapy of endothelial dystrophies depends on
              diagnosis and age: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy will need
              corneal transplantation (e.g. when visual acuity drops below
              0.4). In contrast, transplantation will only be very rarely
              necessary in posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, but the
              intraocular pressure has to be checked frequently. Especially in
              elderly patients with reduced compliance, posterior lamellar
              keratoplasty - preferably in the form of Descemet stripping
              automated endothelial keratoplasty - may be performed instead of
              PKP. In case of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, the
              best time point of PKP has to be determined with regard to
              amblyopia (surgery too late) and inadequate follow-up (surgery
              too early) together with parents and pediatric ophthalmologists
              on an individual basis. In conclusion, for stage-related therapy
              of corneal dystrophies, besides contact lenses, PTK and PKP,
              various techniques of lamellar keratoplasties represent an
              indispensable enrichment of our corneal microsurgical spectrum

               left eye and a deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) in the
               right eye is described. The merits of PK versus DALK for visual
               rehabilitation in macular corneal dystrophy are discussed.
               METHODS: After deep lamellar dissection in the left eye, the
               remaining bed of residual stroma, Descemet membrane, and
               endothelium was unacceptably hazy and thus converted to PK. The
               right eye had successful DALK because a relatively clear bed was
               noted after deep lamellar separation using the big-bubble
               technique. RESULTS: The spectacle-corrected visual acuities at
               2-year follow-up are 6/6 OD and 6/9+ OS. There is mild residual
               haze in the right eye, although the visual acuity is better in

               METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of 84 eyes with LCD or
               MCD who had DLKP (41 eyes) or PKP (43 eyes). Primary pathology
               consisted of 60 eyes with LCD and 24 eyes with MCD. DLKP was
               performed by either removing stromal tissue gradually, or by
               viscodissection of Descemet's membrane. Graft clarity,
               best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), endothelial density, and
               complications were compared between DLKP and PKP, as well as
               between LCD and MCD. RESULTS: All 84 eyes showed a postoperative
               improvement in visual acuity. The median final BCVA was not
               significantly different between PKP and DLKP groups. Endothelial
               cell loss rates were similar for DLKP and PKP. While the

               intraoperatively or in the early phase, whereas late phase
               complications such as endothelial rejection and secondary
               glaucoma were the main complications in the PKP group.
               CONCLUSIONS: PKP is no longer an automatic choice for the
               surgical treatment for LCD and MCD; DLKP seems to be a safe
               alternative. While DLKP is a favorable method for LCD, MCD may

               such as amyloid and spheroidal deposits, inflammation, and
               vascularization. Special stains including Masson trichrome,
               Congo red, and Alcian blue staining were used whenever required.
               The medical records were evaluated for demographics, clinical
               presentation, history of consanguinity, family medical history,
               and clinical outcome of keratoplasty, which was recorded as
               clear, recurrence of dystrophy, or graft failure. A
               clinicopathologic correlation was attempted. RESULTS: A total of
               144 patients contributed 181 buttons, accounting for 8.1\% of
               keratoplasties performed during the study period. The mean age
               of the patients was 34 +/- 19 years (range 3-72 years) with a
               male:female ratio of 1.6 (89):1 (55). Consanguineous parentage
               was noted in 26\% of cases. History of a similar problem in
               siblings and other family members was elicited in 33 (22\%) and
               14 (9.7\%), respectively. Dystrophies included macular (29.3\%),
               congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (34.8\%), Fuchs
               (16.6\%), and lattice (15\%); the remaining 11\% included
               granular, gelatinous drop-like, Reis-Bucklers, and posterior
               polymorphous dystrophy. Associated histologic changes were
               degenerations (15\%), vascularization (4\%), and inflammation
               (2\%). At a mean follow-up of 42 months, the graft remained
               clear in 148 eyes (81.7\%), failed in 33 eyes (18.2\%), and
               recurred in 5 eyes (2.8\%). Graft survival for all dystrophies
               at the end of 1 year was 94.3 +/- 1.7\%, and at the end of 5
               years was 74.4 +/- 4.5\%. Atypical histologic features did not
               affect graft survival. CONCLUSION: Consanguineous marriages
               possibly contributed to the increase in macular dystrophy and
               CHED in South India. The degenerative changes seen could
               possibly be related to late presentation or unknown
               environmental factors and do not have an effect on the ultimate
               graft outcome.",
